# Elevator-Problem-
To implement the business logic for a simplified elevator model in Python. We'll ignore a lot of what goes into a real world elevator, like physics, maintenance overrides, and optimizations for traffic patterns. All you are asked to do is to decide whether the elevator should go up, go down, or stop.

## Installation : 
1. Make a python virtual enviornment in your preferred system, I  have created virtual env for thios project using pip install and the ran pipenv shell.
```
Recommended python version -----> 3.9 (The LATEST STABLE RELEASE)
Some of the packages are not up-to date with python 3.9 or 3.10
```

2. Clone the repo and navigate to the directory where the manage.py file is located
```
git clone https://github.com/PriyaRani10/Elevator-Problem-.git
```
```
cd Elevator-problem
```

3. Install the requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run the development server
```
python manage.py runserver
```

## Special Note :

1. The code is repeatative in some cases as I have used each view only for one type of HTTP Method to provide a better understanding.

2. PostgreSQL DB is used for portability in GitHub, whose deatail I have mentioned in the .env file using config. 
```
